It's been almost three months since my last post. Last few months have been taxing due to some personal issues. I still have drafts for few articles that I couldn't publish. When I started to blog I decided that I will document everything that I learn, relating web development, as a reference to myself and maybe others.  Topics were never an issue since there is so much to learn. I wanted to improve my writing, learn JavaScript and related frameworks, and complete some projects for my portfolio. Four months and half a dozen articles later, life happened(outside of learning web developmentðŸ™‚).

We're three weeks in 2018 and things have resolved. I do have some resolution I intend to fulfill by the end of this year. Overall self-improvement is my goal. During the first six months I will focus on improving the following :

1. **Health & Fitness**

   No love for love handles anymore. I have started running every morning(or evening) since December last year and it's definitely showing the result. I have lost 2.2kgs. It was difficult for the first week with my legs constantly sore after running and having bad form while running, but it gets easier with each passing day.
   I haven't been consistent for the last month but this year I intend to not miss any day.

2. **Career**

   Becoming hireable as a Jr. Developer. I have already taken some steps towards this goal.

   - **Improving JavaScript**

     To improve my JavaScript skills, I have discovered a great tutorial(s). [JavaScript 30][1] challenge by [Wes Bos][2]. This is a course where you learn to build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials using vanilla JavaScript. While I'm taking this challenge/course I will write about each challenge, about my approach, mistakes and what I learned. I've completed the first challenge and have learned quite a few things already. I'm excited about the other 29.
     The current front-end landscape suggests learning [Vue][3] or [React][4] as the framework of choice. I haven't decided which to learn yet. But frameworks will come after I make some vanilla JavaScript projects for the portfolio.

   - **Redesign Personal Website**

     I am thinking of moving from [Jekyll][5] to [Hugo][6]. I mostly code on my Mac-mini but I also have a windows laptop. The only problem is Jekyll doesn't install on Windows. I am content with Jekyll but I hear good things about Hugo such as it is faster than Jekyll and easier to maintain and installs on windows. I still have to think it over, but it wouldn't be too much work since I'm redesigning the website anyway. Have a look.

      _Articles_

     The new site will also have an page for portfolio projects.
   - **Projects**

     Although I'm having a hard time finding some good projects. I have a list of projects that I think might improve my skills and add value to the portfolio.
     - Hackernews Clone
     - Trello Clone
     - User admin dashboard
     - Truly responsive, cross-browser compliant website.

So it looks like my target for the first six months is to improve my development skills, fitness and become employable as a front-end developer.

The next six months of the year I will continue to improve myself regardless of my status at the end of June.
