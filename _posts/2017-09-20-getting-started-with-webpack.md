A short introduction on [Webpack][1] Javascript module bundler.

## Prerequisites

We require [Node][2] pre-installed on your machines before we dive into the project.
Webpack is a Javascript tool, so you should know Javascript.

## What is Webpack?

Webpack is a **Javascript module bundler**.  

What's a **module bundler** ?

**Module** is an independent, reusable, manageable unit of code that can be used multiple times in the same project or in a different project. Modules are written in separate files. **Bundling** is combining multiple files into a single file.  
So **module bundler** is a programme that takes the **required** modules and **bundle** them in a single file. Now we can add a single script tag reference to this file into your HTML page and Webpack will help browser resolve calls to all required modules.   

Let's look at an example of modules.

`addition.js`
```javascript
    
    module.exports = function(a,b) {
        return a + b;
    }
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

`subtraction.js`
```javascript

    module.exports = function(a,b) {
        return a - b;
    }
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

`multiplication.js`
```javascript

    module.exports = function(a,b) {
        return a * b;
    }
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

`division.js`
```javascript

    module.exports = function(a,b) {
        return a / b;
    }
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

`bundle.js`
```javascript

    let add      = require(./addition);
    let divide   = require(./division);
    let subtract = require(./subtraction);
    let multiply = require(./multiplication);

    let sum        = add(3,4);         // sum = 7
    let quotient   = divide(10,5);     // quotient = 2
    let difference = subtract(6,3);    // difference = 3
    let product    = multiply(6,7);    // product = 42
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

We have four modules here, `addition.js`, `subtraction.js`, `multiplication.js`, `division.js` that each **export** a function that performs an arithmetic operation on two numbers.
We want to use these modules, so we **require** all four modules in `bundle.js`. Since we are exporting functions, we can save the reference in variables and use them. `bundle.js` is added to the script tag in the HTML page. 

But wait! That's not all webpack does. Webpack can help you manage **static assets** like CSS, fonts, images for the front-end. You want to minimize your static assets, compile Saas, gzip your files, want source-maps, webpack has you covered. 
There are a large number of **loaders** and **plugins** available for webpack that perform a lot of tasks beyond just bundling.

Webpack can be used with other tools like npm scripts, Grunt, Gulp to solve problems it doesn't. 


### Getting started

Create a directory and name it whatever you like. I have named it `learn-webpack`. Run `npm init` with `-y` flag or simply press enter for all prompts. Create two directories `src` and `dist`. Within `src` create a javascript file and a CSS file : `main.js` & `style.css`. In `dist` folder create `index.html` file.  

```shell

  $ mkdir learn-webpack && cd learn-webpack

  $ npm init -y

  $ mkdir src dist 

  $ cd src 

  $ touch main.js style.css

  $ cd ../dist

  $ touch index.html
```
{: data-title="Bash"}
Note: `$` sign is command-prompt, and is only used for representation.
{: class="note"}

Fill up the three files with the following content.

Open `index.html` and put the following code in it

```html

  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Introduction to Webpack</title>
      <link href="../src/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello Webpack</h1>
      <script src="../src/main.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
```
{: data-title="HTML"}

in `style.css`

```css

  body {
      background-color: turquoise;
  }
```
{: data-title="CSS"}

and `main.js`

```javascript

  console.log('Hello Console.');
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

The directory structure should be like so:

```markdown

  learn-webpack
  |
  |- /node_modules
  |- package.json
  |- package-lock.json
  |- /src
    |- main.js
    |- style.css
  |- /dist
    |- index.html
```

Open `learn-webpack` in any browser and check if it's working.

![learn-webpack Screenshot](/assets/images/introtowebpack.png)

We see our CSS and javascript are working. Open `devtools > console` to view `console.log` statement from javascript file.

### Installing Webpack.

Use the following command to install Webpack locally.

```shell

  npm install --save-dev webpack
```
{: data-title="Bash"}

### Setup webpack configuration file - `webpack.config.js`

Now that we have setup our project let's write **webpack configuration file**. `webpack.config.js` is where you tell webpack what to do.

Create `webpack.config.js` file at the root of your directory.

```shell

  touch webpack.config.js
```
{: data-title="Bash"}

Fill it with following code.

```javascript

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/main.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

Let's go through it line by line.

**`const path = require('path');`** :  
We use the Node.js built-in path module to resolve relative paths.

**`module.exports = { };`** :  
We export an object using Node.js module syntax.

**`entry`** :  
Specify the entry point for webpack. It can be a single file or an array of files.

**`output: { }`** :  
The object specifying where to output bundles and assets.

**`{ filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')}`** :  
Properties of `output` object. Webpack will spit out `bundle.js` in the output folder `dist`.


### Let's Run it

In order to run webpack type the following code in command-line :

```shell

  ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
{: data-title="Bash"}

`./node_modules/.bin/webpack` is where the Webpack binary is located. This command will tell webpack to search for `webpack.config.js` for configuration.
You can name the config file something other than `webpack.config.js`. In that case run the previous command with `--config` option and the name of your config file, like so:

```shell

  ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config someothername.js
```
{: data-title="Bash"}

Check `dist` folder for webpack generated `bundle.js` file. In `index.html` replace `main.js` with `bundle.js` and check if it's working.
If you open `bundle.js` you will see the Webpack bootstrap code. This code is what makes webpack work with your config. Scroll to the end to see our `console.log('Hello console.')` line from `main.js`.

### Loaders

Webpack works only with Javascript and it treats everything as a module. So how does webpack serve CSS, SCSS, images, fonts, etc? The answer is **loaders**. 
Loaders allow you to convert the static files, as mentioned above, into something webpack can work with: Javascript modules. All your assets are considered modules that can be imported, modified and packed into your final bundle. 
Let's use `css-loader` that will allow us to import CSS files directly from your JavaScript modules.

Install css-loader and style-loader.

```shell

  npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader
```
{: data-title="Bash"}

In `webpack.config.js` add the following lines:

```javascript

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/main.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  /* Add the following lines to use css-loader and style-loader */
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

**`module: {}`** :  
This option determines how the different types of modules within a project will be treated.

**`rules: [{},..]`** :  
Rules can modify how the module is created. They test for a file and apply loaders.

**` {test: /\.css$/,use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]}`** :  
In the code above we test for any file with `.css` extension and apply `style-loader` and `css-loader`. The test file is specified using regular expression. The order of loaders matter as they are applied from right to left. Here `css-loader` is applied first then `style-loader`. `css-loader` will take the `.css` file and wrap it into Javascript module. The `style-loader` will injects CSS, that is exported by the JavaScript module, into a `<style>` tag.

Finally, add `import './style.css';` in `main.js` to make it work.

Change the `background-color` in `style.css` and run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack`. Check if the CSS is working.

There is `ts-loader` for converting typescript to javascript, `babel-loader` to transpiles ES6 to ES5 using Babel, `sass-loader` to compile SASS/SCSS, [and many more][3].

### Plugins

**Plugins** extend loaders functionality. We use plugins for anything a loader cannot do. [Here is a list of plugins][4] at the Webpack website. 
We will install `UglifyjsWebpackPlugin` to demonstrate the use of plugins.

```shell

npm i -D uglifyjs-webpack-plugin
```
{: data-title="Bash"}

In `webpack.config.js` :

```javascript

/* Require the installed plugin */
const UglifyJSPlugin = require('uglifyjs-webpack-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/main.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
      }
    ]
  },
  /* Add the following lines to use UglifyJSPlugin */
  plugins: [
    new UglifyJSPlugin()
  ]
};
```
{: data-title="Javascript"}

We define plugin in the `plugins` array. Any options for plugins can be set within the parenthesis.

Run webpack and open `bundle.js`. We can see `bundle.js` is uglified as shown :

![Uglifyjs Webpack Plugin](/assets/images/bundlejs.png)

Webpack provides a list of plugins [here][4], and some third-party plugins can be found [here][5].
Simply choose and use.

## Conclusion

Webpack may not solve **all** your problems but does provide a solution for a **lot** of problems. For the things that it cannot accomplish you can use it with some other tools like Gulp, Grunt, npm scripts, etc.
Head over to [webpack.org][1] for fantastic documentation and experiment with the different configuration.
