title: "Guide to become a Front-End Developer using Free resources."

It is a challenge to keep up with the changing technologies and practices related to front-end development.
This post lists the free resources, for the technologies and concepts one must know to become a front-end developer.

**Note : I'll keep this list updated, as the landscape that is front-end keeps changing.** 👍🏻

## What is Front-End Development ?

> _Front-end web development, is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing._
> -- [Wikipedia][1]

These lines from Wikipedia sums up front-end development aptly.
At the core, we are using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**, along with other related tools & technologies to create websites or web applications.
There are many great resources available online both paid and free. This guide lists only the **free** resources that I came across on my journey to become a front-end developer. ( Still on my way. 😊 )

I have created three sections for this guide :
1. [HTML & CSS](#html-&-css)
2. [Javascript](#javascript)
3. [Related technologies](#related-technologies)

Each section consist of sub-sections such as _**videos**_ , _**websites**_, or _**online books**_ for corresponding related technologies.

### HTML & CSS

**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content.

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** allows you to style your web page once you have structured it.

### Related technologies

For any front-end developer, tools such as a text editor and browsers provide powerful capabilities. When mastered they make your development process easier. Below I have listed such tools & technologies and resources that will help you master them.

#### Browsers

This is a list of popular browsers in use. Based on your Operating System (and version) some may not be available for your system.( No worries you are already using your favourite browser now.😄 )

- [Chrome][37]
- [Firefox][38]
- [Opera][39]

There is also what is called the _'Developer Edition'_ of popular browsers, that are marketed to developers.
These browsers implement the latest technologies, and powerful tools that simplify debugging and testing.

- [Chrome Canary][40]
- [Firefox Developer Edition][41]

_Note: There is also **Safari** and **Microsoft Edge** that are available for MacOS and Microsoft Windows respectively._


- [Chrome Dev Tools][42]  
_Explore and Master Chrome DevTools by **Code School**._

- [Firefox Dev Tools][43]  
_Scroll down to see tutorial videos._

_Note: Dev Tools work mostly same on every browser. If you are using browser other than Chrome or Firefox than I suggest that you learn dev tools using Chrome / Firefox._

#### Git & Github.

Nearly every project out there is using a _**version control system(VCS)**._

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

For whatever reasons, if you want to undo the changes you made across the project or, you want to recover the files you accidentally deleted !

😎 _" Have no fear, because **Version Control** is here. "_

There are many VCS in use today. The most popular is Git which was created by [Linus Torvalds][44], who created the linux kernel. Part of the reason git became popular as it is today is because of Github. Github allows you to host your code online and integrates git for version control.

Use the links below to learn Git & Github.

- [Pro Git][45]  
_Only book you'll need to learn git._

- [Git and GitHub for Poets][46]  
_Excellent video series that teaches you how to use Github and Git._

- [Try Git][47]  
_15 minutes to get up to speed with git.(Well at least the basics.)_

#### Text Editors

Default text editors provided by your OS is not exactly productive for web development. There are some great text-editors that provide boatload of functionality. They makes writing and editing code much easier.
Mastering your text-editor will boost your productivity and reduce your chances of writing bad code.

Below is a list of popular, free text-editors used for web development.

- [Atom][48]  
_Master atom editor using [this tutorial][49]._

- [Visual Studio Code][50]  
_Master VSCode editor using [this tutorial][51]._
